# Census Demography
#### Public Use Microdata Sample Files
This project consumes Public Use Microdata Sample files (PUMS) files to create a merged, normalized file that can be used for analysis and answer specific queries about demographics in Seattle, specifically:
1. ** Number of residents living below Area Median Income (AMI) thresholds **
2. ** Racial breakdown of People of Color living at 60% AMI in Seattle **
3. ** Languages represented in the neighborhoods **

The American Community Survey (ACS) PUMS are a sample of the actual responses to the American Community Survey and include most population and housing characteristics. These files provide users with the flexibility to prepare customized tabulations and can be used for detailed research and analysis. Files have been edited to protect the confidentiality of all individuals and of all individual households.

The ACS questionnaire contains "household" items that are the same for all members of the household (such as the number of rooms in the home) and "person" items that are unique for each household member (such as age, sex, and race).
